Opinionated collection of JavaScript nice-to-haves.

From the experiences of building the frontends of [ascribe.io](www.ascribe.io),
[whereonthe.net](www.whereonthe.net), and various examples with BigchainDB.


Usage
-----

Simply `npm install -S js-utility-belt` and start using `import { ... } from 'js-utility-belt'` (assuming you've met the [dependencies](#dependencies)!

There are a number of outputs generated by npm after installation, dependending on your
needs:

* `js-utility-belt/lib` - Transpiled, ES5 compatible CommonJS modules (for most module bundlers) (**Default**)
* `js-utility-belt/es6` - Transpiled, ES5 compatible ES6 modules (for newer module bundlers that
  understand ES6 module and can provide tree-shaking; ie. [rollup](rollupjs.org), [jspm](jspm.io),
  [webpack@2](webpack.github.io/docs/))
* `js-utility-belt/bundle` - Transpiled, bundled, and minified UMD modules (for droppin' into your
  site)

### Dependencies

If you are using either of the non-bundled versions (`/es6` or `/lib`), you should make sure your
environment either supports all ES6 features, or you have polyfilled them in (**recommended**:
[core-js/es6](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-6), and
[isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch)).

This is not necessary for the bundled version as all polyfills have already been included.

### Reducing import size

Importing from the base index of either of the transpiled versions (`/lib` or `/es6`) will import
the entire package (even with treeshaking!). To make sure you only import what you need, you can
import just the module (ie. `lib/general`, `lib/cookie`, etc...) or even just the particular
function (ie. `lib/general/safe_merge`, `lib/cookie/get_cookie`) that you want.

If you have treeshaking enabled, you can safely import from the ES6 version at the module level and
let treeshaking remove any unused imports from the module (making function-level imports
unnecessary).


Development
-----------

Any added functions or modules should be structured to allow for selective imports by the user. With
this in mind, there are two rules to follow:

* Modules: Each module should be its own folder
  * Modules should include a `index.js` that re-exports all contained functions
  * Modules should be re-exported through the package's [index.js](./src/index.js) with an
    [extended-export-from](https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from) statement:
    `export * as Module from './module'`
* Functions: Each function should be contained in its own file, adhering to the
  [style guide](#style-guide)'s naming scheme: the file name should be the snake_case form of the
  function's name.

### Style guide

See the [ascribe/javascript](https://github.com/ascribe/javascript) styleguide.
